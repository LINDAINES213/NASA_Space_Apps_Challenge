        <p class="u-text u-text-grey-10 u-text-2"> Hello! Welcome to Eclipses: Perspective is Everything page, where you're going to learn many interesting things. Have you ever seen the Sun or the Moon change their shape or color? That's called an eclipse, and it happens when another object gets in between them and the light, or we can say they align in a straight line, one in front of the other. There are two types of eclipses: solar eclipses and lunar eclipses. <br>
          <br>Here, we're going to tell you more about these eclipses, how they occur, when and where you can see them, and how to do it without hurting your eyes. You'll also be able to play with a thematic maze, see photos and videos of past eclipses, and learn a lot about eclipses. Would you like to know more about eclipses? <br>
          <br>Join us!

            <h2 class="u-align-center u-text u-text-default u-text-1">Why are there eclipses?</h2>
            <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-2"> The Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are like three friends playing together in space. The Sun is the largest and the brightest, and it always stays still. Earth is smaller than the Sun and goes around it. The Moon is smaller than Earth and goes around it. The Sun and the Moon pull on Earth with an invisible force called gravity, which makes Earth tilt slightly and causes the Moon to not always follow the same path. <br>
              <br>Sometimes, the Moon crosses the path of Earth around the Sun and ends up right in between them. Other times, Earth crosses the path of the Moon around itself and ends up right in between the Sun and the Moon. When this happens, a line is formed with the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth, and one of them is blocked by the other. This is called an eclipse, and there are two types: solar eclipses and lunar eclipses. <br>
              <br>Eclipses are like a game of hide and seek between the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth. Sometimes, the Moon hides behind the Earth, and it appears red. Other times, the Moon hides in front of the Sun and covers all or a part of it. Eclipses don't happen very often because the Moon isn't always in the right place to create them. To see them, you have to keep an eye on the calendar and use special glasses or a telescope with a filter to protect your eyes. Eclipses are very beautiful and teach us how this friends in space move.<br>

                <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> How Often Can We See Eclipses?&nbsp;</h3>
                <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Eclipses do not happen all the time. They only happen a few times a year, and they are different in different places. Some places can see more eclipses than others.&nbsp;<br>
                  <br>Solar eclipses are harder to see because you have to be in a very special place on Earth to see them. Lunar eclipses are easier to see because you can see them from anywhere that you can see the Moon at night.

                <p class="u-align-center u-text u-text-4"> The times when we can see eclipses are called eclipse seasons, and there are two of them each year. The Moon goes around the Earth, and the Earth goes around the Sun. However, the Moon does not always follow the exact same path; sometimes it goes a little higher or lower. This causes the Moon's shadow to not touch the Earth, resulting in no eclipses. But during eclipse seasons, the Moon follows a path that allows its shadow to touch the Earth, making an eclipses.</p>

                <h3 class="u-text u-text-default u-text-1"> Why Can't Everyone See an Eclipse at the Same Time?&nbsp;</h3>
                <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Unfortunately, not everyone can see the same eclipse simultaneously because, for example, in a solar eclipse, the Moon's shadow is very small and only touches a tiny part of Earth. This part is called the path of totality. People that are in this path can see the total eclipse, where the Sun is completely covered by the Moon. Those near the path of totality see a partial eclipse, where the Sun is partially covered. People far from the path of totality do not see any eclipse at all.<br>
                  <br>The path of totality changes depending on the positions of the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth. It also varies based on the size and shape of the Moon's shadow, which can be larger or smaller, and more circular or elongated. The path of totality is quite unique and only passes through specific locations on Earth each time there is an eclipse.
