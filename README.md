# Space Apps Challenge - Equipo TinyMinds ðŸ§  - Eclipses: Perspective is Everything ðŸŒ’
## HIGH-LEVEL SUMMARY
Our challenge, which is "Eclipses: Perspective is Everything," aimed to create a story, activity, game, etc., where young children and teenagers could learn and understand what an eclipse is, how it occurs, and provide as much data and information as possible about them. We developed an interactive website that includes numerous images and information covering everything we were asked to address regarding eclipses. We tried to explain it in the simplest and most friendly way possible so that even young children could comprehend what an eclipse is. At the end of this page, we also added a space-themed maze game that can be played after completing their learning reading. <br><br>

## PROJECT DETAILS
Our website begins with images and a welcome message that outlines the page's dynamics, including the new topics you'll learn about, etc. The page itself contains information about eclipses, how they occur, what they are, what types exist, etc., and also includes plenty of images to enhance understanding. In this case, definitions, concepts, and other information about this topic were paraphrased to ensure that young children can comprehend what eclipses are and have effective and enjoyable learning. Towards the end of the page, there is a space-themed maze game to provide additional entertainment for the user.<br><br>

For this project, we used the Nicepages tool, which allows for the creation of web pages using HTML, CSS, and JS in a more visual manner, and it offers the option to use templates provided by the platform. We used GitHub to maintain version control of the project and also to host our web page on GitHub Pages. Additionally, there is a copy of it on the Nicepages platform's servers, allowing it to be hosted there as well if desired. <br><br>

## USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
We used Microsoft's AI Copilot for assistance in paraphrasing a significant portion of concepts and definitions related to eclipses. This helped us present the information in a simpler and more child-friendly language, enabling young children to gain a better understanding of what an eclipse is and comprehend the rest of the information provided on our interactive web page. <br><br>
